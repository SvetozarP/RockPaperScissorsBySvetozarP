The project contains a console version of the famous "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game, written in Python.

The goal of the project was to create code, which is uploaded in GitHub and write documentation for it.

The game itself employs conditional statements and while loops, through which player inputs a letter, corresponding to the choises from the famous game.
Through the Random library in Python, computer move is generated and compared to the player's choice.
Scores are accumulated throughout the game.
Colour added through the Colorama library.

Please see below a screenshot from the game itself:
